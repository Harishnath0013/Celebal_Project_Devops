# Dashboard Overview

## Purpose
The Dashboard Overview serves as the central command center for your Azure hub-and-spoke network infrastructure. It provides a comprehensive view of your network's health, performance, and security status at a glance.

## Key Features

### Network Statistics Cards
- **Total Spoke Networks**: Displays the count of active spoke networks across all environments
- **Security Compliance**: Shows overall security posture with percentage compliance rating
- **Monthly Cost**: Tracks current month's network infrastructure costs
- **Data Transfer**: Monitors total data transfer volume in terabytes

### Visual Network Topology
- Interactive hub-and-spoke network diagram
- Color-coded environments (Production, Development, Staging, Security)
- Real-time connection status indicators
- Spoke network count and status overview
- Clickable elements for detailed network views

### Live Metrics Panel
Real-time performance monitoring including:
- **Network Latency**: Current response times across the network
- **Throughput**: Data transfer rates and bandwidth utilization
- **Availability**: Network uptime and service availability percentages
- **Active Connections**: Current number of active network connections

### Quick Actions
- **Export Report**: Generate comprehensive network reports
- **Create Spoke**: Launch spoke network provisioning workflow
- **View Full Topology**: Navigate to detailed network topology view
- **Refresh Data**: Manually update dashboard metrics
